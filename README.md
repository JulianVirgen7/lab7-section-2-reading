## What did I learn about inline elements
Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Here is an example of the cose used for inline:

<div>The following span is an <span class="highlight">inline element</span>;
its background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of
the inline element's influence.</div>
